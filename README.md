The project is done by taking IRIS dataset my learning. 
The major processes of the projects includes EDA and modelling using ML algorithm using Logistic regression. The EDA includes basic level of analysis followed by applying a simple Logistic regression as the ML model. In future, the dataset may be extended with much more advanced EDA analysis and other ML models.
